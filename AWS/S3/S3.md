[[AWS 1]] #aws 

* S3 stores files in buckets (directories).
* Items in the buckets are called objects.
* Buckets are defined at a region level.
* Naming convention
	* No uppercase, No underscore
	* 3-63 character long
* The objects have a key 
	* Basically absolute path = Bucket location + key
* Max object size is 5TB. If uploading a file > 5 GB then you must use multi part upload.
* At a bucket level, we can version the files by enabling versioning.
	* Its enabled at bucket level and works at key level. So if you re-upload same key, it creates a new version of the key.
	* Enables roll backs to previous versions.
	* This allows safeguarding against accidental and malicious deletes as well.
	* Lifecycle rules can be configured at version level.
	* We are charged for each version stored on S3.
	* When you delete a specific version, it is a permanent change.
	* When you delete an object in a versioned bucket, the object simply becomes the previous version with a delete marker as the current version.
	* 
* S3 Replication: Async replication. both source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled. Buckets can be in different accounts.
	* CRR: Cross Region Replication 
		* Automatic and continuous replication.
		* Deletes are not replicated.
		* Works only if versioning is enabled at both source and destination.
	* SRR: Same Region Replication
* Storage Classes. You can move between classes manually or using S3 Lifecycle configurations. This can help you with [[Cost Optimization]]
	* Standard - General Purpose
		* Low latency and high throughput
		* Big Data analytics, mobile & gaming applications, content distribution etc.
	* Infrequent Access (IA)
		* Less frequent but rapid access.
		* Cost on retrieval is there.
			* Standard IA: Disaster Recovery, Backups
			* One Zone Infrequent Access (One Zone IA): single AZ. Data is lost when AZ is destroyed. Generally used for secondary backup copies of on premise data.
	* Glacier: archiving/backup. Cost = storage + retrieval.
		* Glacier Instant Retrieval: 
			* ms retrieval
			* useful for data accessed once a quarter
			* minimum storage: 90 days
		* Glacier Flexible Retrieval
			* Retrieval:
				* Expedited (1 to 5 mins)
				* Standard (3 to 5 hours)
				* Bulk (5 to 12 hours) : free
			* Minimum storage is 90 days.
		* Glacier Deep Archive
			* for long term storage
			* Retrieval
				* Standard - 12 hours
				* Bulk - 48 hours
			* Min storage: 180 days
* Intelligent Tiering
	* Allows movement between access tiers based on usage.
	* No retrieval charges.
	* Classes:
		* Frequent Access tier: default
		* IA tier: objects not accessed for 30 days
		* Archive IA tier: 90 days
		* Archive Access tier tier: 90-700+ days
		* Deep Archive Access tier: 180-700+ days
* Encryption
	* Server Side: happens at the time of object creation [[Governance, Security and Cataloging]]
	* Client side: user encrypts the file before uploading
		* The client can still use [[KMS]]
* Access Analyzer for S3
	* Used for access monitoring.
	* Evaluates bucket sharing with accounts, ACLs. Bucket Policies, Access Point Policies.
* Snow
	* Snow types:
		* Portable devices used to collect and process data at the edge and Migrate data in and out of AWS. Also used for Edge Computing.
			* Snowcone
				* Rugged
				* Edge computing, storage and data transfer
				* Types:
					* Snowcone: upto 24 TB
					* Snowcone SSD
			* Snowball Edge; upto petabytes
				* Provides block storage and S3 compatible object storage.
				* Types:
					* Storage optimized
					* Compute optimized
			* Snowmobile: < upto exabytes
	* These are offline devices.
	* AWS OpsHub is a local software for managing Snow device. This replaces CLI.
* Storage Gateway
	* Used for Hybrid Cloud

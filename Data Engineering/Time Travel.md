The ability to query a table as it was at some point in time. 

Whenever a new update is made to the table, the OTF effectively creates a new version of the table.

This also enables roll back to a previous version.

Versioning means that older versions of the data are also stored and can still be queried, which could still be problematic for compliance reasons. The OTFs also provide a method to delete older versions or snapshots of a table.

#algo 

* Instance based system
* Essentially learns neighbor related data by memory and makes predictions based on them. A key measure for making these predictions is a distance metric (similarity) such as cosine-similarity or Euclidean distance.
* The other option is a model based method, which attempts to learn the underlying structure of the data.

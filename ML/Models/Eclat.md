# Support

$$ support(I) = \frac{\text {\# transactions containing I}}{\text{\# transactions}}$$

I here is not an individual item but a set of items.

# Eclat Algorithm

1. Set a minimum support.
2. Take all the subsets in transactions having higher support than the minimum support.
3. Sort the rules by decreasing support.

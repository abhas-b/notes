Hands on:
1. Find correlation between volume and spread for a stock to assess strength of movement 
2. Build a mcap weighted spread and mcap weighted volume and find their correlation as a market indicator.

Tenets:
1. Order book tells story of bid ask mismatch and indicates strength of both sides.
2. High volume of limit orders may indicate willingness to absorb.
3. Supply and demand
4. Cause and effect 
	3. Wyckoff cycle of accumulation, uptrend, distribution and downtrend.
	4. Fast reversal patterns
		1. V (climax)
		2. Double top
		3. Pull back
		4. Trap (bull/bear)
5. Effort and result
	1. Price action should reflect volume action. This not happening represents divergence. Participation of large traders can be seen through volume. If the effort is in harmony with the result, it is a sign of the strength of the movement and suggests its continuation. 
	2. If the effort is in divergence with the result it is a sign of the weakness of the movement and suggests a reversal.
	3. The price movement will be in direct proportion to the amount of effort spent. If the two are in harmony, a major effort will cause a movement with a longer duration; while a minor effort will be reflected in a movement of shorter duration.
	4. If there is an indication of divergence, the result tends to be in direct proportion to that divergence. A smaller divergence tends to produce a smaller result and a larger divergence, a larger result.

	1. Development of a candlestick: Big volume should be accompanied with wide spread (VSA). Useful as entry triggers and identification of climax.
	2. Subsequent shift: 
		1. we want to analyze whether the wide spread large volume candle led to movement in the direction of the original candle or in the opposite direction. For bullish movement Wide spread Big volume bullish candle should lead to price increase. 
		2. If we want to treat a movement as an impulse, we will expect to see that high volume at its origin, which would indicate an institutional presence supporting said movement and that the probability is a continuation in that direction.
		3. If we see that a movement is generated without a large volume at its origin, objectively it would appear to be a movement without any institutional participation and this suggests to us that this movement is a correction or, in the case of an impulse, it would denote divergence.
	3. Development of movements: Price movement in the direction of the trend should be accompanied by increasing volume. Against the trend should have decreasing volume. Volume movement going against the price trend indicates divergence. Essentially for trend following price and volume should be correlated. 
		1. Impulsive movements should have higher volumes than corrective movements.
		2. For each impulsive movement volume should scale higher peaks. If this doesn't happen then it indicates divergence. 
	4. By waves: measure the volume that has been traded in each wave (upwards and downwards). A key fact to keep in mind when analyzing waves is that not all volume traded in a bullish wave will be purchases and that not all volume traded in a bearish wave will be sales. 
		1. It is about comparing the current volume wave with previous ones; both with the one going in the same direction and the one going in the opposite direction. 
		2. There is harmony if in an upward movement the bullish impulses are accompanied by bullish waves with a greater volume than the bearish corrections. Harmony also exists if the price hits new highs and each bullish impulse does so with an increase in the volume of the waves. By contrast, divergence exists if the price moves upwards but the bullish waves are ever diminishing; or if in this upward movement the bearish waves demonstrate greater strength.
	5. Support/resistance: a breakout should have high volume and the level should not be given up right after the BO.
		1. The key is to see if the price holds on the other side of the level or not. It may take some time before continuing in the direction of the breakout with a new impulse; as long as it does not lose the level, in principle the breakout should be treated as if it were real.
		2. This can be applied to any type of level. Whether horizontal (supports and resistances), sloping (trend lines, channel lines, inverted lines, converging or diverging lines), dynamic levels (moving averages, VWAP, bands); as well as any other level established by a specific methodology.
	6. Role in trend
		1. Normally, relatively large volumes accompany the termination of a prolonged trend movement, especially if in the latter part they are accompanied by small price advances.
		2. Therefore, high volume after a large downtrend indicates that the decline is almost complete. It may be a selling climax and the start of an accumulation.
		3. Likewise, high volume after a prolonged uptrend indicates that the end of the bullish movement is imminent and that the distribution phase may be beginning.
	7. Lack of interest 
		1. Reversals do not always occur when there is considerable volume (effort) and a comparatively small price movement (result). 
		2. There is another way in which a price reversal may occur and that is due to a lack of interest. Small volumes at the bottom of the market after a significant decline or a bearish correction generally indicate a lack of selling pressure. If there is no interest in going further down, an appearance now from buyers would cause an upturn. 
		3. Similarly, small volumes at the top of a market after a significant rise or a bullish correction generally indicate a lack of buying pressure that would lead the price towards a bearish reversal if sellers were to appear. 
		4. Remember that sudden relative increases or decreases in volume are significant and will help you identify when a movement may be ending.

* Note the key levels/trend line that keeps getting prevented from break. This is most likely smart money defending their positions. Esp at these points volume is good. If this precedes consolidation then even better.

Components of the system:
1. Draw trend line
2. Identify real breakout
3. Execute well

# Trend lines

* Avoid stocks with choppy price action or operator stocks. These will hit SL.
* Avoid stocks with too many large wicks or gaps.
* Consider 6 months to 1 year for the trend line. Holding period: 2 weeks.
* You should consider wicks as part of trend line. Don't ignore them.
* When the trend line is broken decisively, then it can give quick moves.
* Ideally the trend line should have a slope < 45 degrees. Very steep trend may indicate a little less validity.
* The price should respect the trend line. If the price breaks the line too often and reverts back then it's not a sign of a healthy trend.

# Deciding what is a breakout 
Attributes of breakout 
* Trend line broken
* Big candle and fast move
	* Small candle move could indicate either weakness in the move or invalid trend line.
	* We don't consider the scripts which will display a small range of candles after breaking the trend line.
	* The breakout should happen in one day and not split over multiple days.
* Absence of opposite party response 
	* Either selling is absent or smart money is able to absorb the selling.
	* This means absence of big wick.
	* Selling wick < 20% of candle range.
* Good volume
	* If the script showed consolidation before the breakout then all the better.
	* If before the breakout there is short build up, it indicates that sellers failed and chances of a successful breakout will be higher.

# Execution 

Points to consider:
1. Entry
2. Stop Loss
3. Target
4. Risk Reward Ratio
5. % capital at risk

* During downtrend:
	* Entry: above high of breakout candle. Avoid trade if it opens above 2% and comes back to previous day high as it attracts profit booking.
	* SL: below low of breakout candle.
	* Target: beginning of downtrend.
	* RR: 1:2
* During sideways trend:
	* Entry: above breakout candle.
	* SL: below Bo candle.
	* Target: width of the sideways trend.
	* R:R: atleast 2.
* At ATH:
	* Entry: same.
	* Target: related to r:r of 2. Trail SL below every swing low.

## Trailing SL

We need to apply BO rules for next 2-3 sessions after the BO candle comes up.
If after the BO the scrip starts to settle down then it might indicate heavy selling. In such cases retaining original SL (below BO candle) can lead to large losses. It's better to trail SL below the low of current candle.

## Exit

For downtrend, sideways and ath scenarios exit when target achieved. 

Once you get a hang of the system, instead of existing 100% start exiting 75%. Carry the rest with a trailing SL below the low of target candle or below any swing low.

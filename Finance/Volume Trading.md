# Entry

1. Study day must be 52 wk high.
2. Candle should close very near day high.
3. Volume should be atleast double of monthly average.
4. Buy next day above study day's high. Dont place the trade at open. The price should sustain above previous day high for atleast 15 minutes after the open. Especially if it's gap up. For a gap down, wait for the price to go back up previous day's high.

SL: below breakout candle's low.
Stay with the trade until the exit signal arrives.

## When in Profit

* Even for a small profit, look at volume for guidance on next steps.
* Don't book early profits. Look at price action and volume.
* Stick to the SL.
* After the entry, ideal scenario is higher volume buying and lower volume selling. This is called low volume pullback. This further shows strength of breakout.
* You can also sell in tranches. One on completion of target, and other at trend reversal.


## When in loss
Follow SL.
